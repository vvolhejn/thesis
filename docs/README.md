# GitHub pages root

These are the files for the GitHub pages site with audio samples.

GitHub pages insists that the content be in the repo's root or in `docs/`, which is why this directory is named misleadingly.

`index.md` is generated from `index_template.md` using [a Jupyter Notebook](../notebooks/download-samples.ipynb).
